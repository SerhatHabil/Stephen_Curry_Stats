Our main purpose in this study is that is how effective Stephen Curry played at the matches and whether he has an important role of making his team win or not. We actually find out the latter. If he has a big role for his team, what is he doing for that? We wanted to see some results about winning percentage, free throw percentage etc… By looking at these result, we could make some inferences on Stephen Curry.
We applied one t-test, two multiple regressions and one simple linear regression so as to analyze our data.
Moreover, we used lots of pie charts, summary table, box plot and scatter plot.
